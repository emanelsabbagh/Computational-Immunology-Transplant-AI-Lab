# Computational Immunology and Transplant AI Lab (CITA Lab)

Welcome to the **Computational Immunology and Transplant AI Lab (CITA Lab)**, 
founded by **Dr. Eman Elsabbagh, MD MHSc**.

We are a virtual, systems-level research group dedicated to understanding and predicting 
the human immune system after pediatric hematopoietic cell transplantation.

Our work integrates:

- Single-cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq)
- TCR/BCR repertoire analysis
- Immune trajectory modeling
- Machine learning and AI
- Clinical transplant outcomes

to uncover mechanisms of immune recovery, anticipate complications such as GVHD, relapse, 
and viral reactivation, and develop precision tools for clinicians.
