# CITA Lab – Core Research Themes

The CITA Lab is organized around a small number of focused, interconnected themes:

## 1. Immune Trajectory Modeling After HCT

- Longitudinal modeling of T, B, NK, and myeloid cell recovery.
- Single-cell and bulk analyses of immune reconstitution.
- Pseudotime and trajectory methods to understand transitions between immune states.

## 2. Machine Learning for Transplant Outcomes

- Supervised models to predict GVHD, relapse, infections, and graft failure.
- Emphasis on calibration, interpretability, and clinical usability.
- Integration of time-varying immune features with baseline clinical variables.

## 3. TCR/BCR Repertoire Analysis in Transplantation

- Diversity, clonality, and repertoire dynamics before and after HCT.
- Associations between TCR/BCR patterns and relapse, GVHD, immune failure, or durable remission.
- Linking repertoire features with single-cell phenotypes.

## 4. Single-Cell Transplant Immunology

- scRNA-seq of PBMCs, bone marrow, and tissue in transplant recipients.
- Identification of pathogenic and protective immune cell states.
- Ligand–receptor and cell–cell communication analysis in the transplant context.

## 5. Computational Immunology for Nonmalignant Disorders

- Focus on FA, WAS, immune dysregulation and immunodeficiency syndromes.
- Understanding how underlying immune defects shape transplant outcomes.
- Designing risk-adapted, mechanism-guided conditioning and prophylaxis strategies.

## 6. Global Equity in AI-Driven Transplant Medicine

- Methods that can be applied in data-scarce and resource-limited environments.
- Open educational materials and reproducible pipelines.
- Collaborative projects that include centers from diverse regions.
