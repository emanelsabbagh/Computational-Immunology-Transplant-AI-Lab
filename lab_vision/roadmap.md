# CITA Lab – 5-Year Roadmap (Draft)

This document outlines the evolving 5-year roadmap for the Computational Immunology and Transplant AI Lab.

## Year 1 – Foundations

- Establish virtual CITA Lab identity, GitHub, and website.
- Build core analysis pipelines: scRNA-seq, TCR repertoire, basic ML models.
- Complete at least one public-dataset project (e.g., immune trajectory modeling).
- Submit or prepare one manuscript/preprint led by CITA Lab.

## Year 2 – Methods & Network Expansion

- Refine pipelines and develop at least one novel methodological contribution.
- Start 1–2 structured collaborations (e.g., with pathology, AI, or transplant groups).
- Present CITA Lab work at major meetings (ASH, ASTCT, CIBMTR, etc.).

## Year 3 – Toward Formal Institutional Lab

- Use CITA Lab portfolio to support faculty or formal research position applications.
- Begin contributing to IRB-based projects as co-investigator where possible.
- Co-develop grant proposals with collaborators.

## Years 4–5 – Early Faculty Phase (Aspirational)

- Lead IRB-approved projects as PI or co-PI.
- Build a small team (students, fellows, data collaborators).
- Launch multi-center computational immunology projects in pediatric transplant.
- Produce high-impact papers and tools that shape practice and guidelines.

This roadmap will be refined as the lab evolves.
