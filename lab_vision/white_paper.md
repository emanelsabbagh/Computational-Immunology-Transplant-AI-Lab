# CITA Lab – White Paper (2025)

## Executive Summary
The Computational Immunology and Transplant AI Lab (CITA Lab) aims to pioneer the integration of single-cell biology, immune repertoire sequencing, and machine learning to understand and predict immune recovery after pediatric hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Despite major progress in clinical transplant care, immune failure remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. CITA Lab seeks to provide the computational foundation for a new era of precision transplant medicine.

## Problem
The field lacks:
- mechanistic, data-driven maps of immune recovery  
- predictive tools for GVHD, relapse, immune failure  
- standardized, reproducible computational frameworks  
- equitable global access to transplant precision medicine  

These gaps disproportionately affect pediatric patients.

---

## Vision
To reconstruct the immune system after transplant — cell by cell, gene by gene — and transform clinical transplant decision-making through computational immunology.

## Approach

### 1. **Single-Cell Transcriptomics**
- Annotate immune states post-HCT  
- Identify dysregulated pathways  
- Build pseudotime trajectories of immune recovery  

### 2. **TCR/BCR Repertoire Analysis**
- Analyze diversity, clonality, convergence  
- Link repertoire features to relapse and GVHD  

### 3. **Machine Learning & Predictive Immunology**
- Build calibrated models integrating immune signals + clinical data  
- Focus on interpretability (SHAP, feature attribution)

### 4. **Global Equity**
- Open-source pipelines  
- Low-resource computational tools  
- Collaborations with centers across regions

## Expected Impact
- Clinically usable models  
- Reproducible pipelines  
- Foundational single-cell frameworks  
- Improved prediction of post-transplant complications  
- New understanding of immune tolerance, failure, and relapse  

CITA Lab will serve as a bridge between modern AI, computational immunology, and pediatric transplantation.
